# House roster

### Program used to import student data into a database, and then produce class rosters.
This project is part of Harvard's CS50x course.

## Background

Hogwarts is in need of a student database. For years, the professors have been maintaing a CSV file containing all of the students’ names and houses and years. But that file didn’t make it particularly easy to get access to certain data, such as a roster of all the Ravenclaw students, or an alphabetical listing of the students enrolled at the school.


## Usage

With import.py, all of the school’s data is imported into a SQL database (students.db), and roster.py then queries that database to get house rosters for each of the houses of Hogwarts.

$ python import.py characters.csv

$ python roster.py Gryffindor
